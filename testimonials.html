                            <p><strong>Mrs. Hien Do (Age 42)<br>Tan Phu Dist, HCMC, Vietnam<br>UTERINE CANCER</strong></p>
                            <p>"I have Uterine Cancer in 2006. I got surgery and radiation therapy in 2006. I suffered a lot of side effects by this treatment method. I had recognized that it evolved to the metastatic stage of cancer. My cancer was treated in Hospital from 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2015. I have <a href="images/giayravien-Hien_Do.jpg" data-featherlight="image">my Hospital Checkout Receipt</a> in attached file. I was upset because there is a slim chance of surviving this horrific disease.</p>
                            <p>I am fortunate. I have a friend who was traveling to Australia to visit her son. She said that she drank the Hearty Condensed Juice and it is really healthy. She said that after the cancer sufferers tried the juice for months, their health increased. I am still in doubt with this juice. However, I also want to try to cooperate with this peculiar method.  I called the founder of Hearty Juice to give her information about my disease. I received a bottle of the Condensed Juice and I tried to drink it within the first week. I can't imagine that my fecal discharge has been much easier and lighter because I am so painfully constipated that blood came out. I am feeling better and happy after 2 weeks. I took this juice from 3 June 2016 and checked my health mid November 2016 and it was an incredible result. The doctor said that I am now healthy and there isn't a presence of cancer cells inside my blood and body. It is miracle. My biggest regret is that I chose radiation therapy and surgery. If I had a chance to know this juice earlier, I wouldn't have lost my natural body functions. I would like to share this information for anybody who is diagnosed with cancer. Try to drink this juice to enhance your immune system and try to eat healthy food. I'm sure that you will live a happy, healthy, and long life. There is no need to suffer from surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or drugs. If anybody is to have first stage cancer, please do not go with surgery. You should try to use herbal medicine and eat healthy food. I guarantee that you will be healthy and will not lose any of your body parts."</p>

                            <p>"I was diagnosed with liver cancer. I tried the Hearty Condensed Juice from Mrs Hien Do who recommended it to me. The juice was free of charge. I received 2 bottles of the Condensed Juice (about 1 litre total) on 21 Oct. 2016. I started to drink the juice and <a href="images/xetnghiem-HuyDoan.jpg" title="Mr. Huy's test result" data-featherlight="image">tested my health at the end of November 2016</a>. There wasn't any lump in my liver and the AFP test was 81.9/10. In the previous AFP test, my result was 380/10. I am continuing to drink the juice and now feel much better. I also eat Macrobiotic foods and it is developing faster results."</p>

                            <p>"When I went to check my health, the doctor said that I have a lump in my right lung. After that I went to see a specialist doctor and he introduced a letter to see an oncologist in Liverpool. At that time, the doctor said that I need surgery to remove the lump. However, I made a decision that I will not follow the doctor's instructions. I followed my family's way by using herbal juice. I drank the Hearty Condensed Juice and now I am healthy the lump's size has reduced. You can see my test results from the clinic's letter in Bankstown. I am healthy now."</p>
