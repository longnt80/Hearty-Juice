                                <h3 class="animated-element">It’s Easy Being Green!</h3>
                                <p class="animated-element">Unlike many other juice brands, Hearty Juice is not a fruit juice – it’s a green juice. Specially Condensation Juice.</p>
                                <h3 class="animated-element">So what’s the difference?</h3>
                                <p class="animated-element">Fruits naturally contain a type of sugar called fructose – so if your juice contains too many fruits, the chances are its sugar levels will be tipping the high side of the scales too.</p>
                                <p class="animated-element">And we all know too much sugar is not a good thing for our health…</p>
                                <p class="animated-element">Green juice, on the other hand, is made primarily from organic green vegetables – yummy, healthy things like spinach, kale, celery, asparagus, and broccoli. </p>
                                <p class="animated-element">Sure, you can throw in an apple, a kiwi or a handful of berries for some fruity flavour, but your veggie-based green juice will remain reassuringly low in sugar.</p>
                                <h3 class="animated-element">Sounds great - but I’m not sure about the colour…</h3>
                                <p class="animated-element">If downing a glass of the green stuff doesn’t get your ‘juices’ flowing, you’re not alone! In fact, a recent survey found that 28% of adults actually “feared” the look of green juice, despite knowing it was the healthiest option.
                                All we can say to that is, <strong>don’t judge a green juice by its colour!</strong>
                                With an array of awesome flavor combinations – from milder-tasting veggies like celery and cucumber, through to stronger greens such as kale and dandelion, there’s a delicious green juice recipe for everyone.</p>
                                <h3 class="animated-element">‘Green’ on green juice?</h3>
                                <p class="animated-element">If you’re a novice to the world of green juice, just let our friendly Hearty Juice staff know – they’ll be happy to advise on the best flavours for your palate, and can even design a custom green juice recipe just for you.</p>
