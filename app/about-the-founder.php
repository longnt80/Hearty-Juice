                                <p class="animated-element">Christine Le - Founder of Hearty Juice - is a firm believer in the <strong>‘healthy body, healthy mind’</strong> balance. A vegan with a passion for fresh fruit and veg, she was amazed by the fantastic quality of our very own Australian produce when she moved here in 2014 from her native Vietnam.</p>
                                <p class="animated-element">Inspired by the abundance of healthy ingredients all around her, Christine began investigating how to turn this treasure trove of goodness into green juice – fresh, healthy juices made predominantly from organic green vegetables.</p>
                                <p class="animated-element">Her extensive research paid off and her green juice recipes were a hit - <strong>delicious, nutritious and packed with health benefits</strong>. </p>
                                <p class="animated-element">Now there was only one thing left to do - share these <strong>amazingly tasty, incredibly healthy</strong> beverages with Australia! And so…<strong>Hearty Juice</strong> was born!</p>
                                <h3 class="animated-element">A HAPPY, HEALTHY LIFE</h3>
                                <p class="animated-element">For the founder of Hearty Juice, good health is not just about physical improvements.</p>
                                <p class="animated-element">Meditating for at least 3 hours every day, Christine is living proof of the fantastic benefits this practice can bring, for mental health and overall wellbeing.</p>
